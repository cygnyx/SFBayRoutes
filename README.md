# SF Bay Routes

## San Francisco Bay Sail Racing Routes
The JSON file contains routes for sail racing series in the SF Bay.
These routes are based on waypoints included in the file, or in GPX files.
See for example https://github.com/nkiesel/YRA-Marks
Waypoints can be paired to form lines.
These lines can be used as start and finish lines for routes.
